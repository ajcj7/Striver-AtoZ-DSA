# Hard Problems - Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet

This directory contains hard-level Data Structures and Algorithms problems from Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet.

## Structure

Each problem follows this directory structure:
```
ProblemName/
├── Solution.java
├── README.md
├── input.txt
└── output.txt
```

## Template Instructions

### Solution.java
- **Brute Force Approach**: First implementation with clear comments
- **Better Approach**: Optimized solution if applicable
- **Optimal Approach**: Most efficient solution
- Time and Space complexity analysis for each approach
- Sample test cases in comments

### README.md (for each problem)
- Problem statement
- Examples with explanations
- Constraints
- Approach explanations
- Complexity analysis

### Input/Output Files
- `input.txt`: Sample test cases
- `output.txt`: Expected outputs

## Sample Problems Structure

### Current Problems:
1. [Median of Two Sorted Arrays](./MedianOfTwoSortedArrays/) - Binary search problem with complex logic

---

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the specific problem directory
2. Read the README.md for problem understanding
3. Check Solution.java for different approaches
4. Test with provided input/output files

## Contributing

- Follow the template structure for consistency
- Include all three approaches where applicable
- Add comprehensive comments explaining the logic
